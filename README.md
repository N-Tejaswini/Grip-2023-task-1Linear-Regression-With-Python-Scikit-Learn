## **Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn**
In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

## **Problem statement**
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

## To predict:
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

## Steps:
    * Step 1 - Importing the libraries
    * Step 2 - Preparing the data
    * Step 3 - Data visualization
    * Step 4 - Train-test-split
    * Step 5 - Predicting the test set result
    * Step 6 - Predicting the score
    * Step 7 - Evaluating the model
    * Conclusion
